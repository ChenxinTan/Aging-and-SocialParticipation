This is a repository for project "Trajectories of Social Participation among Older Adults: A Cross-country Comparative Study", which is co-authored with Professor Yun Zhou at Department of Sociology, Peking University.

The R script for cleaning and coding CHARLS (China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study) 2015 Cross-sectional Data is currently avaliable at GitHub. Since it is not that straightforward to calculate the clustered standard errors and apply sampling weights in R, I also use Stata for doing regression. And the Stata .do file is also avaliable at this GitHub.
